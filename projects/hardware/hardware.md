title: Hardware Projects

Here you can find the home pages for each project I have worked on that I or other people have created. Many of these projects include retro and single board computers,
including computers with Zilog Z80 processors such as the Z80-MBC2 Single Board Computer, or Motorola 68K processors like the Amiga 500.  

You'll also see other projects involving arduinos, raspberry pi, and a wide range of different hardware types that I own.
