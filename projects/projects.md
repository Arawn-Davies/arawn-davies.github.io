# Projects

Through the years, I have worked on many different types of Computer Science ideas and concepts.  
Some of these, I have wanted to write up about them as a means to document more of the work I do in my professional and spare time.
For this website, I have split each of these into two groups:

#### [Hardware projects](/projects/hardware)
This section consists of projects that involve retro and vintage computers, game console modding, hardware development including PCB
design and digital communication.  

#### [Software projects](/projects/software)
This other section consists of projects that deal with ancient operating systems, game console homebrew, uncommon software architectures 
and operating system design and implementation.  

#### [Blend](/projects/blend)
This final area is where those weird concepts go that bridge the gap between hardware and software, from programming arduinos that
communicate via software to retro computers, and the weird idea of arduinos, raspberry pis, guitars and MIDI all joining in harmony or cacophony, take your pic
