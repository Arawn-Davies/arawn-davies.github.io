I'm a software developer, living in Leicester (United Kingdom if the .co.uk hasn't given it away), and currently studying Computer Science Bsc (with honours) at DMU. My modules include concurrent & parallel algorithms and data structures, object-oriented software development in agile project teams, research and ethics with computer law and web application security management.  
  
In my non-academic time in computer science, I develop in various programming languages such as C/C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java and x86 Assembly on a wide range of operating systems on hardware platforms (x86, PPC, m68k, MIPS, SPARC, ARM and Atmel), with my favorite field being Operating System Development.  
  
In my free time away from computing, I like to spend time with friends and family, listen to music, play guitar and other instruments. 

A lot of my time in computing is an on-going journey beyond the bounds of architecture limits, sharing concepts and new things that I learn across various platforms.  
  
Anyway, I'm rambling. Here I'll be documenting my experiences in this world and the unworldly mesh of computing units and unholy software configurations. I'm glad you stumbled upon this small space on the internet that I call mine. Enjoy the ride.
