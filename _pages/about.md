I'm in my twenties, living in Leicester (England), and currently studying Computer Science Bsc (Hons) at DMU. In my spare time, I like to listen to music and play guitar and other instruments, develop in various programming languages such as C/C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java and x86 Assembly, with my favorite topic being Operating System Development.  

I'm not going to lie, I've had a very interesting life which I won't be going into detail on here. If you want to know, you gotta meet me and get to know me in real life, rather than using a WebKit/Blink browser window ðŸ˜‰
