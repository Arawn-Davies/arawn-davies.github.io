Welcome to my website! I'll occasionally be adding posts on projects I work on, from music, gaming, Z80-based microcomputers, Amiga, PC and anything I find remotely interesting.  
  
For the past 10 years, I have spent countless hours working on software and hardware that is odd, forgotten and obsolete (to quote one of my favorite YouTubers, LGR)  
Programming using a wide range of languages from x86 assembly, C/C++, Java, C#, HTML, PHP, CSS, MBASIC (yeah CP/M is pretty cool surprisingly), on a equally-wide range of hardware platforms (x86, PPC, m68k, MIPS, SPARC, ARM and Atmel).  
  
I tend to journey beyond the bounds of architecture, and share concepts and new things that I learn across them.  Programming and utlising to the fullest extent any piece of hardware I can find has long been a favorite hobby of mine, and has resulted in pretty whacky projects (e.g. running a web server on Linux running on a PlayStation 2 - wild I know)  
  
Just be prepared to see this website being a huge messy blend of UNIX on an Amiga 500 and low-level operating systems written in high-level languages on .NET. Be sure to check out the projects page where you'll see detailed pages of what I do, when and what they entail.  
  
Thanks for sticking around, you won't be disappointed!
