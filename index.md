Welcome to my website! I'll occasionally be adding posts on projects I work on, from music, gaming, Z80-based microcomputers, Amiga, PC and anything I find remotely interesting.  
  
You can see more info about myself and my projects by going to '[About](/about)' or '[Projects](/projects)' on the top menu bar.  
  
If you're interested in my servies and career, you can visit '[Hiring](/hiring)' to see my CV. If you're as interested in my blogging and documenting of experiences, be sure to check out '[Blog](/blog)'.  

  
Thanks for sticking around, you won't be disappointed!
