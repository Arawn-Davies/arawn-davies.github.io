Welcome to my website! I'll occasionally be adding posts on projects I work on, from music, gaming, Z80-based microcomputers, Amiga, PC and anything I find remotely interesting.   
You can see more info about myself and my projects by going to 'About' or 'Projects' on the top menu bar.  
    
Be sure to check out the projects page where you'll see detailed pages of what I do, what they entail and how.  
  
Thanks for sticking around, you won't be disappointed!
