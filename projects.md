Here you can find the home pages for each project I have worked on that I have created, maintain or contributed to  

## Founded projects
#### [Personal GitHub](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies)
Here I have smaller projects which are either incomplete or in-my-eyes less impressive or more arbitrary than my serious projects, so they probably won't be too detailed or will be highly experimental. Proceed with caution.  
#### [Siaranite Solutions](/projects/siaranite.md)  
Here I have my more professional and major projects which may be submodules of collective projects, such as the case of Medli and the Siaranite Disk File System. These projects are made to strict outlined specification and tend to be more stable.  
#### [Medli Operating System](/projects/medli.md)  
Medli is an operating system I have been writing in C# off-and-on for 10 years. It implements a C# compiler that converts .NET common intermediate language code into pure x86 machine code, allowing applications written in C# to be ran on bare-metal, removing the middle man bloat of Windows, macOS and Linux

#### [This Website](https://github.com/Arawn-Davies/arawn-davies.github.io)
You can find this website's source repository at GitHub. I use Jekyll with the remote-theme plugin that uses the upstream Minima theme, allowing me to use a dark skin for the site.  

## Contributions
#### [Cosmos - C# Open Source Managed Operating System](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos)  
I have contributed in the role of core team member to the C# open source managed operating system 'Cosmos', which provides a toolkit and migration method for developers to create low-level bare-metal operating systems from .NET into machine code running on x86 and other platforms.  
Medli has been my implementation of the project to create a new operating system environments tuned specifically for cross-platform architecture communication and messaging.  
#### [Aura Team](https://github.com/aura-systems) and [Aura Operating System](https://github.com/aura-systems/Aura-Operating-System)  
Myself and the core team of Aura Systems have contributed to Cosmos in collaboration to enrich the features provided by Cosmos with implementing network protocols and executable formats with system calls.
