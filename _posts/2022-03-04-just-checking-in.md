It's been about 1 and a half years since my last blog post. 
What can I say? Covid has turned reality into a time machine where you can forget about things without realising.
This time though, I plan on making writing this blog a more regular thing.

I'm half way through my degree, and it's been an awful lot of hard work but it's falling into place now.
I had my first job in September '21 where I worked as a customer support specialist. 
Good pay, which made up for the frustrating calls from school secretaries complaining they had forgotten their passwords.

My course grades hacev also been a lot better than last year. November 2020 I slipped and broke my wrist, resulting in me wearing a full length arm cast to keep it stable for 2 months until I could take it off on New Year's Day. Pretty bad considering I'm doing a computer science degree and couldn't type longer than 5 minutes at a time. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

My modules I've done this year have been:

Java:  
> Data Structures & Algorithms  
> Concurrent and Parallel Algorithms  
> Object Oriented Design  
> Object Oriented Development  
  
PHP:  
> Web Application Development  
  
C#:  
> Agile Team Development  
  
Git:  
> Software and Security Management  
  
Other:  
> Introduction to Research and Ethics  

I've done the first half of the year, which was OO Design, Data Structures & Algorithms, Web App Development and Software & Security Management. These went by quickly but the remaining 4 modules are proving to be quite tasking. 
Thankfully they're not too unworldly but still I'm actually learning something academically related to IT for once!  

This was just a quick update, so be sure to check this space soon for exciting things coming soon!
