Over the past few days, I have been polishing up my online spaces such as this website, and the homepages of my various projects and documents. I am excited to take this domain into the next level, with interactive features and archival libraries which may either be public or private for just myself and a few others. I have got plenty of resources at my disposal to make great use of the marvels of computer science, although I do stress the importance of having miscellaneous documentation and files being stored in an effectively organised manner. 

Too long do I find myself scouring through my 2x 4TB external drives, trying to find a 56kb file I just wrote to last week. When working across filesystems, platforms and systems, it can get tricky getting fast indexed search operating smoothly.  
  
I now will keep the domain apex ```arawn-davies.co.uk``` as a portal to redirect visitors and myself to the right place for them to be. When looking for random hobbyist projects, tehy will be directed towards my hobbyist development playground, where people can expect things to be experimental. If a visitor or myself is looking for software written to extensively detailed specifications, then they will be directed to my Siaranite Solutions website. If someone wants to read about what I write, they can go to my blog, or if they wish to look up my career, they can go to the Hiring page and send me a message ðŸ™‚  

What I'm trying to get to, is that I will not let my personal webspace become such a desolate, neglected contentless wasteland, and instead encourage it to become an important resource to getting through the madness.
